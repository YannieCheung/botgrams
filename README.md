# MasterOfPuppets - World of Warcraft Classic Grind Bot 
Please star this repo if you think it might be useful to you or other coders.

- Uses an Addon to read the game state. 

- The bot state is shown in a browser and so can be monitored from your phone or a tablet while you do something else.

- No DLL injection or memory watching, just screen capture and mouse and keyboard clicking.

- All classes except Hunter are possible.

# Getting it working

## 1. Download this repository

Put into into a folder. e.g C:\WowClassicGrindBot-. I am going to refer to this folder from now on, so just substitute your own folder path.

## 2. Install Addon

In this repo is a folder Addons e.g.  C:\WowClassicGrindBot\Addons. Copy the contents into your wow classic Addons folder. e.g. c:\World of Warcraft\_classic_\Interface\AddOns.

There are 2 addons:

* Bindpad - This makes it easier to bind keys to commands or macros. e.g. F1-F12
* DataToColor - This is the addon which reads and displays the game state.


## 3. Build the bot

You will probably already have Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code installed. You need to build the bot. Build this from the IDE or use powershell.

e.g. from powershell

    cd C:\WowClassicGrindBot\BlazorServer
    dotnet build

## 4. Configure the Addon Reader

1. Delete the existing config.json file found in c:\WowClassicGrindBot\BlazorServer, we are going to recreate it. This is important as your screen may not be 1920 x 1080.
2. Edit the batch script in c:\WowClassicGrindBot\BlazorServer called run.bat, change it to point at where you have put the addon folder e.g.

        start "C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe" "http://localhost:5000"
        c:
        cd C:\WowClassicGrindBot\BlazorServer
        dotnet run
        pause

3. Execute the run.bat. This will start the bot and Chrome.

    a. If you get "Unable to find the Wow process is it running ?" in the console window then it can't find wow.exe.

4. You should see the 'Addon configuration' screen.

5. We need to read the position of the pixel and to do this we need to put the addon into configuration mode by typing /dc. Follow the instructions on the configuration page.

6. Restart the bot and it should not start up and show the dashboard page.

## 5. Configure the Wow Client - Interface Options

### Interface Options

From the main menu (ESC) set the following:

* Interface Options - Controls - Auto Loot - Ticked.
* Interface Options - Controls - Interact on Left click - Not ticked.
* Interface Options - Combat - Do Not Flash Screen at Low Health - Ticked.
* Interface Options - Combat - Auto Self Cast - Ticked.
* Interface Options - Camera - Auto-Follow Speed - Fast
* Interface Options - Camera - Camera Following Style - Always
* Interface Options - Mouse - Click-to-Move - Ticked
* Interface Options - Mouse - Click-to-Move Camera Style - Always

## 6. Configure the Wow Client - Key Bindings:

From the main menu (ESC) set the following:

Key Bindings:

| Command |  Key |
| ---- | ---- |
|  Interact With Target | H  |


This is an important key bind !

## 7. Configure the Wow Client - Bindpad addon

Bindpad allows keys to be easily bound to commands and macros. Type /bindpad to show it.

For each of the following click + to add a new key binding. The most important ones are marked with a *.

|  Key |  Command | Description |
| ---- | ---- | --- |
|  i |  /use hearthstone | |
|  o |  /use Chestnut Mare Bridle | Your mount here|
|  u | /tar targettarget | Warlock only |
|  y | /cast counterspell | Mage only |
|  t | /cast blink | Mage only |
|  F1 | See below | Buff weapon 16 (Melee classes) |
|  F2 | See below | Buff weapon 17 (Melee classes)|
| * F3 | /cleartarget  | |

    Rogue weapon buff (use 17 for second weapon):
        /use Instant Poison V 
        /use 16
        /click StaticPopup1Button1 

    Melee weapon buff:
        /use Dense Sharpening Stone
        /use 16
        /click StaticPopup1Button1         

    Delete various
        /run for b=0,4 do for s=1,GetContainerNumSlots(b) do local n=GetContainerItemLink(b,s) if n and (strfind(n,"Slimy") or strfind(n,"Red Wolf") or strfind(n,"Mystery") or strfind(n,"Spider L")) then PickupContainerItem(b,s) DeleteCursorItem() end end end


## 8. Setting up the class file

Each class has a configuration file in /Json/class e.g. the config for a Rogue is in  C:\WowClassicGrindBot\Json\class\Rogue.json

See the other class files for examples. Your class file probably exists and just needs to be edited to set the path file.

BTW hunter is not supported.

### Path

The path that the class follows is a json file in C:\WowClassicGrindBot\Json\path\ which contains a list of x & y coordinates to walk.

        "PathFilename": "58_Winterspring.2.json", // the path to walk when alive
        "SpiritPathFilename": "58_Winterspring_SpiritHealer.2.json", // the path from the spirit healer back to the main path.
        "PathThereAndBack": true, // if true walks the path and the walks it backwards.
        "PathReduceSteps": true,  // uses every other coordinate.

## Commands

The rest of the file contains a set of commands e.g.

    
        "Name": "Slice And Dice",
        "Key": "3",
        "MinEnergy": 25,
        "MinComboPoints": 2,

This is the sequence of commands that are used when pulling a mob.

### Combat

The sequence of commands that are used when trying to kill a mob. The first on the list is used each time combat is actioned.

### Adhoc

These commands are done when not in combat and are not on cooldown.


## Requirement:

A requirement is something that must be true. 

#### Value base requirements

Value base requirements are made up on a [ Health% or TargetHealth% or Mana%] [< or >] [Numeric Value].

e.g. "Health%>70",

e.g. "TargetHealth% < 10",

e.g. "Mana%<40",

#### npcID requirements

If a particular npc is required then this requirement can be used.

e.g. "not npcID:6195", - don't cast on npcId 6195 https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=6195
e.g. "npcID:6195", - only cast on npcId 6195 https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=6195

#### Bag requirements

If an item must be in your bag then you can use this requirement. Useful to determine when to create warlock Healthstone or soul shards.

It has the format BagItem:[itemid]:[count]

e.g. "BagItem:6265:1 - Must have a soulshard in the bag https://classic.wowhead.com/item=6265
e.g. "not BagItem:19007:1" - Must have a lesser Healthstone in the bag https://classic.wowhead.com/item=19007
e.g. "not BagItem:6265:3"- Must not have 3 soulshards in the bag.

#### Buff / Debuff

Allow requirements about what buffs you have or the target has to be evaluated.

e.g. "not Well Fed" - I am not well fed.
e.g. "not Thorns" - I don't have the thorns buff.

# User Interface

## Other devices

The user interface runs in a browser. This allows you to view it from another device on your lan.

You will need to open up port 5000 in your firewall.

Control Panel\System and Security\Windows Defender Firewall - Advanced Settings

* Inbound Rules
* New Rule
* Port
* TCP
* Specific local ports: 5000
* Allow the Connection
* Private, Public, Domain (You may get away with just Private)
* Name "Wow bot"

## Components

The UI has the following components:

### Screenshot

![Screenshot Component](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/julianperrott/WowPixelBot/master/images/screenshotComponent.png)

### Player Summary

Show the player state. A hyper link to wowhead appears for the mob you are fighting so you can check out what it drops.

![Player Summary](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/julianperrott/WowPixelBot/master/images/PlayerSummary.png)

### Route

Shows:

* The main path
* The spirit healer path
* Your location
* The location of any deaths

### Actions

This component contains a button to allow the bot to be enabled and disabled.

This displays the finite state machine. The state is action which can run and has the highest priority. What determines if the action can run are its pre-conditions such as having a target or being in combat. The executing action is allowed to complete before the next action is determined.

Some actions (combat,pull target) contain a list of spells which can be cast. The combat task evaluates its spells in order with the first available being cast. The action then gives up control so that a higher priority task can take over (e.g. Healing potion).

The visualisation of the pre-conditions and spell requirements makes it easier to understand what the bot is doing and determine if the class file needs to be tweaked.
